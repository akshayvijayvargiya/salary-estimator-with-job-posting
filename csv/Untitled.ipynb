    "We collected salary information on data science jobs in a variety of markets. Then using the location, title, and summary of the job we attempted to predict the salary of the job. For job posting sites, this would be extraordinarily useful. While most listings do not come with salary information, being to able extrapolate or predict the expected salaries from other listings can useful.\n",
