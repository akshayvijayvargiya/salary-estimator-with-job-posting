You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.  3+ years of engineering experience Things move quickly in the data group. You’ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.  Professional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar This will be a significant component of your responsibilities.

You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.  Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued  Data Science Background While not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.

Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.  Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.  Continuous Integration & Deployment IZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible.
